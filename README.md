## Abstract
Diagnosing rare diseases presents significant challenges due to their unique and complex nature, often leading to delayed interventions and sub-optimal patient outcomes. However, the recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning are revolutionizing healthcare, particularly the diagnostic process. This paper introduces "Diagnosis Assistant," a novel web-based application developed to assist medical professionals in accurately identifying and diagnosing rare diseases. The application leverages the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Orphanet databases, two critical resources, to provide a transformative approach to diagnosing rare diseases. The application analyzes and interprets data from these databases, enabling timely and precise diagnoses and paving the way for earlier interventions and improved patient outcomes. An example case study demonstrates the potential utility of the Diagnosis Assistant in facilitating complex diagnostic processes, especially for rare diseases. The applicationâ€™s source code is openly accessible, inviting continuous improvement and adoption in diverse healthcare settings. By augmenting the diagnostic process, the Diagnosis Assistant has the potential to improve patient care and treatment outcomes significantly.
